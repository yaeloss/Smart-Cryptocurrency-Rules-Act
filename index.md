The purpose of the <i>"Smart Cryptocurrency Rules Act"</i> is to provide state and local legislators with a template of consumer-friendly policy on Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized finance. 

As a <a href="/policy/">model policy</a>, it serves the purpose of providing general guidelines or goals to achieve in state legislation, and will therefore require various amendments, customizations, and accomodations with existing laws and regulations.

State lawmakers and their staff are encouraged to take parts, or the whole, of this model policy to help usher in consumer-friendly policies on cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance in their jurisdiction.

Members of the public are encouraged to suggest their own edits.
