## Getting started

This GitHub repository will serve as the living model for the <i>Smart Cryptocurrency Rules Act</i>. 

Edits, modifications, and additions are welcome by all. Doing so helps better crowdsource the most appropriate and beneficial rules on digital assets such as Bitcoin and its crypto-offspring, as well as any industries, projects, or protocols which may support them.

Considering the complex nature of digital assets and decentralized blockchain technology, there are inevitably concerns that are not addressed by this model policy. However, this repository should serve as only a template for future action and language, while remaining loyal to the consumer-friendly principles of open and decentralized blockchains and related industries.
